But be careful, even if the previous notebook might seem a little bit boring, it is of great importance. We switched from images to text data in this exercise, and remember the first steps that we did in our class were also data related, and they were essential for all the following exercises. So naturally, since we switched to text data in this exercise, make sure you have a good understanding of how the data has been prepared.\n","\n","For the last I2DL exercise, we want to make use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to process sequential data.
